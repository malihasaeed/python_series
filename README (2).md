# 🏥 Patient Follow-Up Flag System

This Python program simulates a simple hospital workflow. The user enters a list of patient IDs, and the system flags the ones that require follow-up based on whether the ID number is even or odd.

- Even-numbered ID → FOLLOW-UP REQUIRED
- Odd-numbered ID → Normal Checkup

## How to Run
1. Save the code as patient_followup.py
2. Run the file using Python
3. Enter patient IDs separated by commas

Example:
101,202,303,404
